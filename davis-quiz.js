    "description": "When the UL is too busy to focus, the study lounge is occupied with other chatty students, and, there’s only one other place to go for students looking to get their lives together: Davis library. In a place so monstrous, it can be hard to decide where to set up camp. Take this quiz to find out what floor of Davis library will work best for you.",

        "description": "You might not need the intensity of Davis’s study environment right now - either that, or your answers have revealed to us that while you say you’re going there to be productive, we both know that you’re not really gonna go there and be productive. Run off some energy, smile and laugh while you can, and then, once you really don’t have it together, come back to this quiz again.
