    INSTRUCTIONS:

    This template will be processed by a computer program,
    so formatting is VERY important. 
    
    Make sure not to delete or switch around any quotes, commas, colons,
    parentheses, or brackets. 
        
    Do not start new lines (i.e. type Enter) inside a set of double-quotes.
    Only start new lines when copying-pasting or on a blank line.
    
    Anything inside these symbols:
    / *      * /
    is an instruction. Do not write any quiz information there 
    because the program won't look at it.

    "description": "Halloween on Franklin Street had me reminiscing about the good old days. My childhood years of romping through the garden, playing house with my sister, and settling down in front of my computer and hacking away at the keyboard to avoid getting eaten by a mean digital shark. Yeah, I get hooked early.  I don't really know what happened, but suddenly I was on CartoonNetwork.com scrolling through their vast library of arcade games looking for the ones I played as a kid. Rather than fight the urge to gleefully play all my favorite games from my childhood, I decided to compile some of my favorites â€” both those found online and those kept in a plastic CD-ROM case.   	Before we start, keep in mind that these are my games, friends. If you're mad I didn't include this or that game, my apologies.  	(Bonus points if you got the reference to the game I mentioned in the first paragraph!)",
