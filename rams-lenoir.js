/*

    INSTRUCTIONS:

    This template will be processed by a computer program,
    so formatting is VERY important.

    Make sure not to delete or switch around any quotes, commas, colons,
    parentheses, or brackets.

    Do not start new lines (i.e. type Enter) inside a set of double-quotes.
    Only start new lines when copying-pasting or on a blank line.

    Anything inside these symbols:
    / *      * /
    is an instruction. Do not write any quiz information there
    because the program won't look at it.
